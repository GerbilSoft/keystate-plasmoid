HOWTO: add new keys
-add a checkbox and a KColorButton to the config's "Key Information" tab
-add the corresponding stuff in the main.xml KConfigXT file
-add the corresponding stuff to 'configuration.js' (the script's configuration object)
 this includes:
   * boolean flags whether to show the indicator or not (the checkbox from the config UI)
   * the color of the button (the KColorButton from the config UI)
-the correct constants to 'constants.js'
 this includes:
   * a constants for the DataSource (name of the object in the 'keystatus' DataEngine)
   * the english translation of the key
-you need to add the key to the key information list in 'keyinformation.js' (in the updateKeys function)
-you need to add the key to the switch/case statement in 'keyinformation.js' (in the getText function)
-register the DataSource with the DataEngine in 'plasmoidhandler.js' (in the registerPlasmoidEvents function)
-add the DataSource to the switch/case statement in 'plasmoidhandler.js' (in the dataUpdated function)
