HOWTO: add new keys
-add a checkbox and a KColorButton to the config's "Key Information" tab
-add the corresponding configuration options to the main.xml KConfigXT file
-add the corresponding key configuration to 'keyconfiguration.js' script:
   * add a constant for the key
   * call this.addKey() for the new key in this.initialize()
-the correct constants to 'constants.js' (a constant for the DataSource - which is the name of the object in the 'keystatus' DataEngine)
-add localization information for the key to 'localization.js'
