Weird error message when starting the plasmoid first?
-> TODO: check if it's reproducible.

TODO: fix the code which tries to guess a perfect size for the plasmoid.
(I need help there - if one has a smart solution please tell me :))

Goals for the first stable version:
-world domination :)
-get this plasmoid included in KDE
