Weird error message when starting the plasmoid first?
-> TODO: check if it's reproducible.

TODO: move the "Alt" key to the very end of the key list.
(the flow of the keys on the keyboard is like: shift, control, super, alt, altgr).

TODO: fix the code which tries to guess a perfect size for the plasmoid.
(I need help there - if one has a smart solution please tell me :))

TODO: split even more drawing code from the layouts.
Currently a "horizontal" and a "vertical" mode would have to be implemented for each layout.
Of course this is bad.
Thus: move the horizontal/vertical layouting code out of the specific layouts (into a generic class).
(NOTE: do we have to care about right-to-left here?
DEV info: maybe we could use QPainter.rotate()?)

TODO: create a symbol layout (Junior-Job?).
Suggested symbols (by Dotan Cohen):
Shift: ↥
Ctrl: ^
Super: ⚐
Alt: _

Goals for the first stable version:
-world domination :)
-get this plasmoid included in KDE
