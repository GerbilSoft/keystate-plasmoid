Weird error message when starting the plasmoid first?
-> TODO: check if it's reproducible.

Figure out why "preferring a size" takes up to 80% cpu (on my core2duo)
=> maybe a plasma bug? doesn't happen in plasmoidviewer (it happens only
in my panel)

User requests:
There should be a configurable delay before the key state is shown.
This way, when typing, the key state plasmoid will not flash every time the
user hits e.g. the shift key.
In English writing, this happens at least once per sentence!

Goals for the first stable version:
-world domination :)
-get this plasmoid included in KDE
