Most important:
The default colors are hardcoded at the moment. As usual: hardcoded values
cause problems. One is that it's currently not possible use colors from
the theme.
SOLUTION: QColor.setThemeColor():

TODO: write a "SvgLayout" which basically replaces the "SymbolLayout".

Other:
Weird error message when starting the plasmoid first?
-> Can anyone reproduce this? I can't.

Nice to have:
plasma's KConfigXT parser needs the ability to parse
and execute code from the "default" tag - as shown here:
http://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/Using_KConfig_XT#.kcfg_Structure
(<default code="true">KGlobalSettings::generalFont()</default>)

User requests:
There should be a configurable delay before the key state is shown.
This way, when typing, the key state plasmoid will not flash every time the
user hits e.g. the shift key.
In English writing, this happens at least once per sentence!

Goals for the first stable version:
-world domination :)
-get this plasmoid included in KDE
